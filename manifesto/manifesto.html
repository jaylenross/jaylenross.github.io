    <h2>Design offers a visual solution to problems that arise from the world around us.  <br> The power design possesses has always attracted me to it as a medium as it is  <br> persuasive, direct, and continuously adapting. My work as a designer reflects  <br> my interests as I look to solve problems within the modern world. I often find   <br>myself immersed in color, form, and line with wonder about how design can take   <br>these small elements and create work that has the power to move people to action.<br> 
    <br>
I am declaring a concentration in design and interested in continuing to delve  <br> deeper into design and its problem-solving abilities. The past four semesters of   <br>exploring different types of design whether systems, typography, algorithmic,   <br>and UI design have strengthened my eye and heightened my curiosity. I plan to   <br>continue to take courses in other mediums such as photography and print as I begin  <br> further incorporating these mediums in my work. 
        <br><br>
I often find myself creating work around the topics of self-awareness, blackness,   <br>and heritage. These themes have slowly crept their way into my design work but   <br>show most prominently in work of other mediums. As I continue to develop with  <br> certain mediums, I am interested in how these topics will shape the art I will create.   <br>With design, my interests are in branding and visual identity which are each a unique   <br>experience as I continue to identify overlaps and differences between these systems.   <br>I plan to continue to take courses that surround these subjects both in visual arts   <br>and marketing which will strengthen my design skills and process as I continue to  <br> search deeper into the many facets of design.
